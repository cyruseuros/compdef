* Overview
We keep reinventing the wheel on how to set completion backends
locally. =compdef= does this for you for both CAPF and company, with
some auto-magic thrown in for convenience.  =compdef= is intentionally
stupid. I've seen some really powerful solutions to this problem, but
they all seem to assume a certain approach to configuring completions
and are thus usually embedded in a starter kit like Doom Emacs,
Spacemacs... =compdef= isn't that clever. It just works.

* Examples
** CAPF
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (compdef
   :modes '(emacs-lisp-mode lisp-interaction-mode ielm-mode)
   :backends '(helm-lisp-completion-or-file-name-at-point
               ggtags-completion-at-point
               t))
#+end_src

** Company
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (compdef
   :modes 'lua-mode
   :backends '(company-lua company-capf)
   :company t)
#+end_src
